I had no idea how to structure the MVC for a video game
After research, I ended up doing :
Model : game logic
Controller : receives input from the operator
View : displays on screen
Game : loops for the game to progress -> I didn't know if that was supposed to be a controller "game", it could be refactored if i'm wrong.
